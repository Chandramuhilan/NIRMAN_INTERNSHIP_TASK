    I am 13 years old. I live with my family. There are 3 people in my family, me, my mother and my father.
    One special thing about my family is that they are very kind hearted to everyone and soft spoken. 
    One thing I really enjoy is play, playing cricket and taking wickets.
    A fun fact about me is that I see in mirror and talk by myself. 
    One thing people don't know about me is that I once stole a toy from one of my cousin.
    My favorite subject is science because it is very interesting. 
    Through science I can explore the whole world and make the discoveries and improve the lives of others. 
    Thank you for listening."""
