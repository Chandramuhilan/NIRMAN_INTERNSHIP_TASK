TRANSCRIPT:
Hello everyone. Myself Muskan. Studying in class 8B section from Christ Public School. I am 13 years old. I live with my family. There are three people in my family. Me, my mother and my father. One special thing about my family is that they are very kindhearted to everyone and soft spoken. One thing I really enjoy is play, playing cricket and taking wickets. A fun fact about me is that I see in mirror and talk by myself. One thing people don't know about me is that I once stole a toy from one of my cousin. My favorite subject is science because it is very interesting. Through science I can explore the whole world and make the discoveries and improve the lives of. Others, thank you for listening.
